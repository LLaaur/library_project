# library_project

Library website made with HTML CSS and JS.

Things I learned:

I. How to work with constructors.

II. Field attributes (read-only, submit, reset etc)

III. How to save input field content in a variable (and use it afterwards).

IV. Deeper knowledge of css grid and it's handful properties like auto-fill and minmax().
